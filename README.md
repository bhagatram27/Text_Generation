Text Generation with Fine-Tuned DistilGPT-2
Overview:
This project revolves around the fine-tuning of the distilgpt2 model from the HuggingFace Transformers library on a custom dataset. The aim is to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on the patterns and information found in the uploaded dataset.

Model Details:
Model Name: DistilGPT-2 (distilgpt2)
Library Used: HuggingFace Transformers
Tokenizer: GPT-2 Tokenizer
Special Tokens: Pad Token ([PAD])
Optimization Algorithm: AdamW
Learning Schedule: Linear schedule with warmup
Dataset:
The dataset consists of user-uploaded text files. These texts are then chunked into smaller sequences to ensure they fit within the model's token limit.

Data Splitting: The training dataset is further split into training and validation subsets, with an 85%-15% ratio respectively.
Chunk Size: Each text sequence is broken into chunks of 200 tokens.
Training Details:
Epochs: 3
Batches: 275 per epoch
Batch Size: 8
Average Batch Processing Time: ~8.92 seconds
Total Training Time (Epoch 1): 2924.65 seconds
Training Loss (Epoch 1 to 3): Reduced from 1.6271 to 1.0509
Validation Loss (Epoch 1 to 3): Reduced from 1.0978 to 1.0257
Performance Metrics:
Test Loss: 1.1296
Perplexity: 3.0945
Challenges Faced:
Data Handling: Ensuring the uploaded text data fits within the model's token limit while maintaining contextual information.
Optimization: Achieving consistent improvements across epochs while preventing overfitting.
Compute Time: Managing computation resources for efficient processing, especially given the size of the GPT-2 model and the extensive data.
Usage:
To use the model for text generation, provide a prompt and let the model generate contextually relevant text based on the learned patterns from the dataset.

Future Directions:
Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different learning rates, batch sizes, and warmup steps to further optimize performance.
Expand Dataset: Incorporate more diverse texts to increase the versatility of generated content.
Deployment: Implement a user-friendly interface to allow users to easily generate text based on various prompts.
